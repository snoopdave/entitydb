Acting as a web development export who knows WebPack very well, I want you to
you to create a small TypeScript and Node project for me. This project should
allow me to npm run start a simple web server that exposes the files in the project's
data directory at the URL http://localhost:9090/data, but it only services files with the extension .jpg

Please list the files to be generated then as for a approval to proceed.

Next, generate all files and make sure they are complete with NO OMISSIONS and no TODOs.

After each file, ask for approval to procede to the next until all files are completely generated.
